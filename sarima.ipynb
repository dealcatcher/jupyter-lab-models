    "\n",
    "**What the output tells us**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High counts** (e.g., 150+ entries):\n",
    "  - Product with extensive price history\n",
    "  - Multiple observations over time\n",
    "  - **Excellent for time series modeling**\n",
    "  - Can detect trends and seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medium counts** (e.g., 20-50 entries):\n",
    "  - Reasonable historical data\n",
    "  - Sufficient for basic trend analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low counts** (e.g., 1-5 entries):\n",
    "  - Limited history\n",
    "  - Not suitable for time series modeling\n",

    "**Why this matters**:\n",
    "- **Product selection**: Helps choose which products to analyze in detail\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   df_id = df_id[df_id[\"prices.isSale\"] == True]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Keeps only records where product was actively on sale\n",

    "3. **Display results**:\n",

    "- **Case study methodology**: Deep dive into one product before generalizing\n",
    "- **Data richness**: This product has sufficient history for analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Visualize correlations between all numerical variables in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this code does**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select only numerical columns**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df_heat = df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Filters DataFrame to keep only numeric data types\n",
    "   - Excludes strings, dates, and boolean columns\n",
    "   - Necessary because correlation requires numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate correlation matrix**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df_heat.corr()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Computes Pearson correlation between all numeric pairs\n",
    "   - Values range from -1 to +1\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create heatmap visualization**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\n",
    "   sns.heatmap(df_heat.corr(), annot=True, cmap=\"coolwarm\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `annot=True`: Shows correlation values in each cell\n",
    "   - `cmap=\"coolwarm\"`: Blue (negative) → White (zero) → Red (positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add title and display**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plt.title(\"Electronics Products Pricing Data Correlation Heatmap\")\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to read the heatmap**:\n",
    "- **Dark red** (~0.7 to 1.0): Strong positive correlation\n",
    "- **Light red/pink** (~0.3 to 0.7): Moderate positive correlation\n",
    "- **White** (~-0.3 to 0.3): Little to no correlation\n",
    "- **Light blue** (~-0.7 to -0.3): Moderate negative correlation\n",
    "- **Dark blue** (~-1.0 to -0.7): Strong negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected correlations**:\n",
    "- **prices.amountMin ↔ prices.amountMax**: Very high positive (0.9+)\n",
    "- **price_difference ↔ prices.amountMax**: Positive (larger max = larger difference)\n",
    "- **discount_percent ↔ price_difference**: Positive correlation\n",
    "\n",

    "- Identifies multicollinearity issues\n",
    "- Helps select independent variables\n",
